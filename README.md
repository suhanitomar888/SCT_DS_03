SkillCraft Technology Internship - Task3
Super excited to share my work building a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchases using the Bank Marketing dataset.

🛠 Tools & Skills Used:
⚡ Python (sklearn) – for building and training decision tree models
🔁 Data Preprocessing – to prepare clean inputs for ML

🎯 Key Highlights:
🌳 Built interpretable decision paths for predictions
🧠 Strengthened ML fundamentals with real data
💡 Understood customer behaviour patterns and classification techniques

This project deepened my knowledge of supervised learning, machine learning models, and business applications. Thank you SkillCraft Technology for this practical learning opportunity.
